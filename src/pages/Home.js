                            Budgeting is similar in many respects to losing weight, which is something 
                            that is both straightforward and complex, simultaneously. 
                            Weight loss is simple in the sense that there are only two primary factors 
                            which influence it:

                            </Col>
                            <Col sm="6">

                            To lose weight, a person's energy expenditure must be consistently greater 
                            than their energy intake (energy expenditure {'>'} energy intake). This is known 
                            as an energy deficit and creating one simply involves eating less and exercising 
                            more. Simple enough, right? In this case, why is it that so many people struggle 
                            with losing weight or maintaining a healthy weight? The reason is that there are 
                            many other factors (both internal and external) which influence a person's energy 
                            intake and energy expenditure.  To complicate matters, these factors are interrelated 
                            and dynamic. For example, a person over 100 kg may struggle to achieve the energy 
                            deficit needed to lose weight due to a medical condition they are taking medication 
                            for, which increases appetite. The person may also have an injury or be limited in 
                            terms of the type of physical activity they can perform. In addition, if the person 
                            has been that weight for a significant period of time their body may have developed 
                            a homeostatic 'set point', which will cause it to resist weight loss efforts by 
                            releasing hunger hormones like ghrelin. All of these factors will also decrease their 
                            intrinsic motivation which is required to adhere to an exercise regimen. Therefore, 
                            in order for this individual to successfully lose weight and maintain that healthy weight, 
                            it will be necessary for them to address many of these factors which influence energy 
                            intake and energy expenditure. This may involve seeking medical advice to change to a 
                            medication which does not increase appetite, finding a form of physical activity they 
                            are able to perform consistently, and enlisting the support of personal trainers or 
                            training partners to keep them accountable and motivated on their weight loss journey.

                            Budgeting is similar to weight loss in the sense that there are only two primary 
                            factors which influence whether we are in the black or red: 
                        </LargeText>
                        <LargeTextList>
                            <li>Income</li>
                            <li>Expenditure</li>
                        </LargeTextList>
                        <LargeText>
                            In other words, achieving a budget surplus is as simple as consistently spending less 
                            than we earn. However, as with weight loss, there are many interrelated and dynamic 
                            factors which influence income/expenditure and which should be addressed to reach one's 
                            financial goals. This is the purpose of this application. It has been developed to 
                            simplify the budgeting process so you can see exactly where your money is going, which 
                            will enable you to pinpoint areas of wasteful spending, and help you develop ideas for
